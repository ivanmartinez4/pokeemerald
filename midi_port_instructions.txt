- Converting instruments and volumes
    DP and HGSS square leads should be transposed up one octave (12 semitones)
    HGSS: Check every program change event and look for ones higher than 39.

- Delete all CC 16 and CC 20 events

- Executing midfix4agb

- Volume of any PSG should be multiplied by 160%

- Check pitch bends
    Multiply every negative pitch bend by 99%
    Half the pitch bend range if it stays within -4096 and 4095
    Delete pitch bend events from channels that do not use pitch bends.
    Delete CC 6 and CC 20 events from channels that do not use pitch bends.

- Check for modulation (CC 1) and show channels that use it
    Delete all CC 1, CC 21, CC 22 and CC 26 events for channels that do not use modulation.
    Show CC 22 showing the CC 1 channels.
    Are values blank or equal to zero?
    Yes:
        Delete CC 22 events in channels that do not use CC 22.
        Show CC 23 showing the blank or zero CC 22 channels.
        Multiply CC 1 by the value of CC 23 divided by 6 rounded up to the nearest hundredth.
        If CC 23 is blank, assume it is 1 and multiply CC 1 by 17%
    No:
        Show CC 23 showing the non-zero CC 22 channels.
        Multiply CC 1 by the value of CC 23 divided by 2.
        If CC 23 is blank, assume it is 1 and multiply CC 1 by 50%
    
    Show all channels that use CC 1 and show CC 21
    Multiply all CC 21 events by (210 / current BPM) [105/c if -X]

    Multiply all CC 26 events by (current BPM / 480) [c/240 if -X]

- Convert all CC 14 events to CC 39
